# SAP-Final-Project
Program designed to emulate the actions of an assembler, virtual machine, and debugger. 
Has a full user interface where the user can read in .txt files including pseudo-assembly code into the machine. Then the user can execute the files where there is a full list of errors for different issues the user could encounter. Also, the user has the option of putting stops in their code like a regular debugger.
